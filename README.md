# astro-strata

HTML5Up's Strata template ported to Astro.

## Slug

_I am Strata, a super simple responsive site template freebie crafted by HTML5 UP._

## Notes

The original template uses dummy images and custom JavaScript files. These have been ported over to Astro "as-is".

If one were to rewrite this template natively in Astro, the _image_ and _script_ implementation would be much different in order to leverage more of Astro's incredible goodness. Doing that is left as an exercise to those who clone this site.

## Using the template

Please see the **Astro Starter Kit: Basics** section below.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
